            <p>Online-Shopping Software’s main purpose is to provide customers with the possibility to perform online purchases of products made available by the retailers. 
                Customers are identified properly and are able to perform online transactions using two kind of methods: either using credit card or banking documents. Online Customers are divided 
                on two categories upon user account types: seller and buyer.</p>
                
            <p>Basic accounts beside other attributes contain a specific one named Fidelity which deals with the number of years the user has been joining the online shop. On the other hand is business plan which is characterized uniquely 
                by the Volume attribute that is the total amount of transactions performed within the online shop. The customer is able to operate 
                throughout the system after properly authenticated. He is able to create a cart and add products to it or delete them as well. 
                The buyer can also chat with the seller to negotiate the prices. Then he decides whether he might go on with the checkout operation 
                and complete the purchase. Once the user decided upon the plan to use: basic or business, he is given the alternatives to pay through
                the previously mentioned methods accordingly. Once the purchase is confirmed by the customer and admitted by shop commission, customer 
                details come into use in order to define the delivery address and other supplementary information. Customer is given the possibility 
                to view and print some information regarding his activity on the shop. For instance he can print the number of purchases completed
                by him from the beginning of the current year.</p> 
            <p>He can print the status of previously performed purchases and decide whether to cancel or not a specific purchase if it is 
                still in “Not available” status. After the purchase he will get a confirmation mail.</p>
            <p>During the process of product selection and addition to cart specifying correspond quantity the 
                system automatically checks if the product is available within the quantity or not. In case of negative response 
                the system generates a request to the product supplier. Stated in short terms this is the overall situation on hand.</p>
            <p>We have chosen exploratory development model. The basic idea behind this method is to develop a prototype, allowing software developers to take advantage 
                of what was learned during development of earlier parts or versions of the system.
